  \section sec_TWG_Storage_Concept_Storage Storage Concept
  Storage is similar to the sequence container defined in
    <a href="">C++ Standard, Section 23.2.3</a>, with efficient (constant cost) access to the elements.
  The following standard containers meet the Storage requirements:
  <ul>
   <li> \c std::vector </li>
   <li> \c std::array </li>
  </ul>
